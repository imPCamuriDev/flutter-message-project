# Simple Chat Flutter

Project based on WhatsApp Web.

Made with Flutter and WebSockets in JavaScript and Express.js.

The project currently only has a simple system for sending and receiving messages; the Status page is static.

Made with the intention of learning how to work with Flutter technology and its components from the Material offered by Google.

The project's default database is PostgreSQL.

A Brazilian project made with love by me <3
